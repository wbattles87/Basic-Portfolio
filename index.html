				Hi there!  As you may be able to notice, my name is Will Battles and welcome to my Basic Portfolio Page.
				This is the first of many pages I will be creating for the UT Coding Bootcamp class and this was made using
				just HTML and CSS frameworks.
				<br>
				<br>
				So about me!  I have two bachelor degrees, one in business from Texas A&M at Galveston and a Computer Engineering
				degree from UHCL.  I went back for the second degree because I wanted a change and I loved computers so it seemed
				like a natural fit.  Now that I am attending this bootcamp, I hope to have the necessary skills when I leave to be able
				to attain a front end or full stack position.
				<br>
				<br>
				In this page, you will the links to my contact info as well as my LinkedIn and GitHub pages!
			</p>
